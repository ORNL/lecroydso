ActiveDSO Connection
--------------------

The ActiveDSO control can be used programmatically and as an embedded control.   Software 
designers can create instances of the ActiveDSO control within their programs, and use the controlâ€™s 
Methods and Properties for instrument communications, setup, and data transfer.  With ActiveDSO, all 
details of the interface bus used to connect to the Teledyne LeCroy instrument are encapsulated within 
the ActiveDSO control.  The intricacies of programming for each of these interfaces is hidden from the 
user, allowing the software developer to focus on his or her application and to avoid the complexities 
of the lower-level interface calls.
